#The methods like __len__, __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__ a
# re special or magic methods in Python. They allow you to define or 
# customize the behavior of your objects when they are used with common operators
#  or built-in functions, such as len(), indexing, assignment, and deletion.

#Hereâ€™s the point of these methods: they provide a way for your custom classes
#  to emulate Python's built-in types (like lists, dictionaries, and tuples) by
#  defining their expected behavior.

# in short it enables you to use built in methods in your logic

    def __init__(self, data):
